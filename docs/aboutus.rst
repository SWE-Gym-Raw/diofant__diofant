About
=====

The `Diofant`_ project is a fork of the `SymPy`_, started by Sergey B
Kirpichev, last regular SymPy's commit is :commit:`cbdd072`, (22 Feb
2015).  The git history goes back to 2007, when development was in svn.

The project was named after the Diophantus of Alexandria.  His
"Arithmetica" is one of the earliest known texts that use symbols in
equations.  "Diofant" is a transliteration of Диофант, from Russian.

SymPy
-----

`SymPy`_ is a team project and it was developed by a lot of people.
Please refer to the `AUTHORS
<https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/AUTHORS>`_ file in the
`SymPy repository <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/>`_ for up-to-date
list of contributors.

Please note that that list is incomplete intentionally, because some
former SymPy developers don't want to be mentioned in the context of
the SymPy or derived projects.

The project was started by Ondřej Čertík in 2005.  Please refer
to it's `README.rst <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/README.rst>`_
for a brief history.  Ondřej Čertík is still active in the community, but
is too busy with work and family to play a lead development role.
Unfortunately, his remaining activity neither constructive nor productive
anymore and SymPy just slowly dies now: most former contributors are inactive
or explicitly leaving this "friendly and welcoming" project.

This unfortunate situation was major reason to fork the
SymPy as the `Diofant`_ project.  Development in the new project will
be open and public, without hidden double standards, centered about
good, proved code and not project popularity counters.  Here we believe
that mathematical correctness is more important than political one.
